# Change Sidebar Ordering

Dokz doesn't sort your sidebar links on any particular oder, this is because Dokz generates the sidebar links based on the `pages` directory tree

To give a specific order to your sidebar you can use the `sidebarOrdering` prop in the `DokzProvider`:

```jsx
import { DokzProvider } from 'dokz'
import React from 'react'

const order = {
    'index.mdx': true,
    anotherDirectory: false, // use false to exclude directories and files
    pageName: true, // you can omit the mdx extension
    folder: {
        page1: true,
        page2: true,
        page3: true,
        subfolder: {
            page3: true,
            page4: true,
        },
    },
    // paths not present will be put at the end
}

export default function App(props) {
    const { Component, pageProps } = props
    return (
        <ChakraProvider>
            <DokzProvider sidebarOrdering={order}>
                <Component {...pageProps} />
            </DokzProvider>
        </ChakraProvider>
    )
}
```

## How it Works

The order is specified with an object, every key is a file or an object path

Every value can be `true`, which means the current key is a file path, or can be another object, meaning the current key is directory

If the value is `false` the corresponding file or directory will be excluded from the sidebar

Paths that are not in this ordering are put at the end.
