# Writing MDX

MDX is a format that lets you seamlessly use JSX in your Markdown documents. You can import components, like interactive charts
and embed them within your content. This makes writing long-form content with components a blast.

More details about MDX in the [Official website.](https://mdxjs.com/)

## An example react component inside markdown

Below there is an example of a `graphiql` component directly imported inside the markdown

export const query1 = `
{
    continents {
      code
      name
    }
}
`

<Box
    borderColor='red.500'
    borderWidth='2px'
    borderRadius='lg'
    overflow='hidden'
    shadow='xl'
>
    <MiniGraphiQL url='https://countries.trevorblades.com' query={query1} />
</Box>

To show that component i just needed to write the following `mdx`

```md
import { MiniGraphiQL } from 'mini-graphiql'
import { Box } from '@chakra-ui/react'

export const query1 = \`
{
continents {
code
name
}
}
\`

<Box my='40px' borderRadius='lg' overflow='hidden' shadow='xl'>
    <MiniGraphiQL url='https://countries.trevorblades.com' query={query1} />
</Box>
```

> Remember that to declare variables inside MDX you have to export them, this way mdx understands that it is jsx code instead of markdown

## Importing relative components

The example below assumes we have an exported component named `Button` in a file named `Button.jsx`/`Button.tsx` located in the same folder as the `.mdx` file we are editing.

```mdx
---
name: Hello world
---

import { Button } from './Button'

# Hello world

Hello, I'm still a mdx file, but now I have a button component !

<Button
    onClick={() => {
        alert('You clicked me')
    }}
>
    Click me
</Button>
```

With MDX you can mix _React Components_ or _html-elements_ with regular markdown allowing you to either document your own components _or_ create helper components that make documentation easier.
