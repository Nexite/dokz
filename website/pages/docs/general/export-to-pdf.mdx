# Export to pdf

You can export a document to pdf using the browser "print" functionality and selecting "save as pdf"

Dokz styling is optimized for pdf exporting and does some things like hiding the side nav and the nav bar

## Limitations

Even if dokz support pdf export, there are still some limitations that are being worked on:

-   Cannot export when in dark mode
-   Bad styling of images when using the `![]()` syntax (because MDX wraps them inside `p` tags)
-   Code snippets are sometimes cut between pages
